# Poppy robot printed parts
A collection of only the 3D-printable parts for the Poppy robot

The collection of all the 3D parts necessary to get buildig a Poppy robot are a bit out of place from the originator. This repository contains just those STL files that one needs to use to start printing right away.

There are PNG files that are a snapshot of each of the parts, however, the STL viewer in GitHub will demo them in a 3D view.

Thanks to the [Poppy project](https://www.poppy-project.org/en/) and its [authors](https://github.com/cartheur/poppy-humanoid/blob/master/doc/authors.md).
