# Poppy robot printed parts
A collection of only the 3D-printable parts for the Poppy robot

The collection of all the 3D parts necessary to get buildig a Poppy robot are a bit out of place from the originator. This repository contains just those STL files that one needs to use to start printing right away.

There are PNG files that are a snapshot of each of the parts, however, the STL viewer in GitHub will demo them in a 3D view.

In the subfolder [printer](printer/Guider-IIs/) you will find prepared models for the FlashForge Guider IIs 3D printer. This was chosen due to its large print area, good quality as noted in the community, and ability to auto-generate support structures for the more difficult Poppy parts. Otherwise, these parts have been printed on a Lulzbot Mini2.

Support for the FlashForge printer [spool](printer/Guider-IIs/spool) has the STL file to print a supplimental filament holder since the one that comes with the Guider IIs is only for FlashForge-branded filaments. The folder also contains the FlashForge file with supports. Thanks to [Steve Wagg](https://www.thingiverse.com/waggster/designs).

A subdirectory containing all the files necessary to construct your own manga 4.3 LCD [screen](screen). Thanks to [Elias Bakken](https://bitbucket.org/%7B7682d009-eb9d-4484-8950-f592ff392b75%7D/) for sharing this from his successful Kickstarter project.

A subdirectory containing [literature](literature) has the Ph.D. thesis where Poppy began. Here you will also find some academic papers on [safety](literature/safety) considerations whenever 3D printing is to be performed.

Thanks to the [Poppy project](https://www.poppy-project.org/en/) and its [authors](https://github.com/cartheur/poppy-humanoid/blob/master/doc/authors.md).
